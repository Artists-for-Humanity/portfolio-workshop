                        <P> From an Irish Legend, legend has it that Stingy Jack had invited the Devil to have an drink
                            with
                            him. But Jack didn't want to pay for the drink, so he convinced the Devil to turn into a
                            coin.
                            He
                            took the coin and kept it close to an silver cross, preventing the devil from turning back
                            to
                            it's
                            original form. With the devil at such pathetic form, Stingy Jack had promised to let the
                            Devil
                            escape. Only if he had leave Jack alone for a year; where if Jack had died, the Devil had
                            vowed
                            to
                            not claim his soul. This continued for a year, and as Stingy Jack died. God didn't want such
                            sorry
                            person in Devil, neither did Hell had accepted him. So Jack was sent back off into the night
                            with an
                            burning coal that lit his path. Where he had placed the coal inside a carved-out turnip, and
                            had
                            been roaming the Earth ever since. As the Jack o'lantern is known to be an pumpkin, its
                            origins
                            take
                            form in turnips, beets, and potatoes: in Ireland and Scotland.</P>

                            now know as Jelly Belly Co. As Corn was known to be a staple feed for Chicken, Candy Corn's
                            origin was known as "Chicken Feed" and was illustrated with a colorful rooster on the box.

                        <P>Having children dress up in costumes and go door-to-door like little beggars demanding treats
                            is kind of weird. Like several other Halloween activities, the tradition can be traced back
                            to the Middle Ages and the rituals of Samhain.

                            It was believed that phantoms walked the earth on the night of Samhain, so people would
                            dress up in costumes in an effort to repel the spirits.

                            As the Catholic Church started supplanting pagan festivals with their own holidays (like All
                            Souls' Day), the act of souling became popular, and poor children and adults would go
                            door-to-door dressed as spirits accepting food in exchange for prayers.

                        <P>Halloween we know today can trace its roots back to the ancient Celtic end-of-harvest
                            festival of Samhain. During Samhain, people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward
                            off evil spirits.

                            In the eighth century, in an effort to spread Christianity, Pope Gregory III decreed
                            November 1 as All Saints' Day and incorporated some of the rituals of Samhain. All Saints'
                            Day was also called All Hallows and the night before, when the traditional Samhain festival
                            used to take place in Celtic regions, was called All Hallows' Eve.
